This guide is intended for publishers who want to monetize a Unity app.

Integrating the Google Mobile Ads Unity plugin into an app, which you will do here, is the first step toward displaying AdMob ads and earning revenue. Once the integration is complete, you can choose an ad format (such as native or rewarded video) to get detailed implementation steps.

Prerequisites
Use Unity 5.6 or higher
To deploy to iOS
Xcode 11 or higher
CocoaPods
To deploy to Android
Google Play Services 18.1.0 or higher
Target Android API level 14 or higher
Recommended: Create an AdMob account and register an Android and/or iOS app
Download the Mobile Ads Unity plugin
The Google Mobile Ads Unity plugin enables Unity developers to easily serve Google Mobile Ads on Android and iOS apps without having to write Java or Objective-C code. The plugin provides a C# interface for requesting ads that is used by C# scripts in your Unity project.

Use the links below to download the Unity package for the plugin or to take a look at its code on GitHub.

Import the Mobile Ads Unity plugin
Open your project in the Unity editor. Select Assets > Import Package > Custom Package and find the GoogleMobileAdsPlugin.unitypackage file you downloaded.

Make sure all of the files are selected and click Import.

Include the Mobile Ads SDK
The Google Mobile Ads Unity plugin is distributed with the Unity Play Services Resolver library. This library is intended for use by any Unity plugin that requires access to Android specific libraries (e.g., AARs) or iOS CocoaPods. It provides Unity plugins the ability to declare dependencies, which are then automatically resolved and copied into your Unity project.

Follow the steps listed below to ensure your project includes the Mobile Ads SDK.

Initialize the Mobile Ads SDK
Before loading ads, have your app initialize the Mobile Ads SDK by calling MobileAds.Initialize() This needs to be done only once, ideally at app launch.


Select an ad format
The Mobile Ads SDK is now included in your Unity app when deploying to either the Android or iOS platform. You're now ready to implement an ad. AdMob offers a number of different ad formats, so you can choose the one that best fits your user experience needs.
